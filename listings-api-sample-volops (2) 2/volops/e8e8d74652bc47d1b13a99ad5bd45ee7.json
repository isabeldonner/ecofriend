Every meal saved stays out of the landfill, helping the environment, while also nourishing our community in need. The volunteer role would involve:- Picking up meals from one of our donors, Burlington Stores HQ, in Burlington, and- Delivering these meals to our non-profit community partner/s in Burlington. Each volunteer task should take no longer than 90 minutes including travel time between donor and recipient. Pick-up will be on Thursday afternoons at 3:00 pm from Burlington Stores HQ and the drive to our NPO recipient in Burlington, which should be no more than 10 minutes away.
