Every meal saved stays out of the landfill, helping the environment, while also nourishing our community in need. The volunteer role would involve:- Picking up meals from our donor cafeteria, and- Delivering these meals to our non-profit community partner/s in the nearby area. Each volunteer task will take approximately one hour including travel time between donor and recipient. We require volunteers to drive their own car. We welcome regular participation but will work with your schedule. Insulated bags will be provided to carry food donations.<strong>For this specific rescue, we are looking for volunteers to rescue and transport food from a private school in Morristown to an NPO partner in Dover, NJ. The volunteer will be needed on FRIDAY mornings at 8:30 a.m. and the distance between the school and NPO is 10 miles, and what looks like a 17 minute drive.</strong></p>", "expires": "2025-08-18T00:00:00Z", "org": {"id": "c9284b4d46e347708872a2f0fc2bb4b2", "name": "SHARE MY MEALS", "logo": "https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/resize=width:600,height:315,fit:max/quality=value:90/dnjrH2PRva0deWq3hfVk", "areasOfFocus": ["COMMUNITY_DEVELOPMENT", "ENVIRONMENT", "HUNGER_FOOD_SECURITY", "MENTAL_HEALTH"], "orgType": "NONPROFIT", "is501c3": true, "isBCorp": null, "isSocialEnterprise": null, "locale": "en", "governmentId": "844149439", "address": {"full": "120 John Street, PRINCETON, New Jersey, US", "line1": "120 John Street", "line2": null, "city": "PRINCETON", "state": "New Jersey", "stateCode": "NJ", "zipcode": "08542", "country": "US", "latitude": 40.354265, "longitude": -74.662, "cityOnly": false}, "url": {"en": "https://www.volunteermatch.org/search/org1211622.jsp", "es": "https://www.volunteermatch.org/search/org1211622.jsp", "pt": "https://www.volunteermatch.org/search/org1211622.jsp"}}, "group": null, "locale": "en", "address": {"full": "Morristown, New Jersey, US", "line1": null, "line2": null, "city": "Morristown", "state": "New Jersey", "stateCode": "NJ", "zipcode": null, "country": "US", "latitude": 40.792297, "longitude": -74.47631, "cityOnly": true, "description": null}, "applyEmail": null, "applyUrl": "http://sharemymeals.org", "applyText": null, "applyOnIdealist": false, "locationType": "ONSITE", "remoteOk": false, "remoteZone": null, "remoteState": null, "remoteCountry": null, "startDate": null, "endDate": null, "startTime": null, "endTime": null, "timezone": "America/New_York", "starts": null, "ends": null, "actionType": "VOLOP", "actionTypeText": null, "isCovid": false, "isPostedAnonymously": false, "directions": null, "welcomeGroups": false, "welcomeFamilies": false, "welcomeTeens": false, "welcomeIntl": false, "welcomeAge55Plus": false, "welcomePrivateCorpGroups": false, "detailsStipendProvided": false, "detailsTrainingProvided": false, "detailsHousingAvailable": false, "detailsCulturalSupport": false, "detailsAcademicCreditAvailable": false, "detailsWheelchairAccessible": false, "orientationRequired": true, "backgroundCheckRequired": false, "driversLicenseRequired": true, "feeRequired": false, "feeAmount": null, "isRecurring": true, "timesOfDay": ["WEEKDAYS_DAYTIME"], "expectedTime": null, "commitmentDetails": "Volunteer jobs usually take about 60 minutes but can be less depending on the assignment.
