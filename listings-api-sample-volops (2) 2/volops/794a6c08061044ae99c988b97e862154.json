To amplify its reach, I'm seeking several individuals to contribute in a focused way. This is a mutually beneficial exchange - your contribution will directly support a project aimed at democratizing access to vital technological knowledge, and in turn, you\u2019ll gain valuable experience and mentorship.</p><p>You\u2019ll simply contribute by writing 8-10 thoughtful, engaging comments daily on a specific social media account for just four days a week (you choose the days). This small effort takes about an hour a day, and I\u2019m a slow commenter-it could take you even less time.</p><p>In return for this contribution, there are several tangible benefits to be gained:</p><p><strong>Real-World Business Acumen:</strong> Gain hands-on experience with the business side of social media management and see how data truly drives online growth. This kind of insider knowledge can be invaluable if you ever consider ventures in this space.</p><p><strong>Professional Endorsements:</strong> Show real results, and you\u2019ll receive a personal LinkedIn recommendation plus one on another trusted job platform of your choice. These endorsements will help you stand out in a competitive market.</p><p><strong>Personalized Mentorship:</strong> This isn\u2019t compulsory, but if you\u2019re interested, you\u2019ll have access to weekly one-on-one mentorship sessions with me. I\u2019m a data coach and I help professionals from Asia and Africa break into tech and data. This is your dedicated hour to get support, guidance, and clarity on your journey into tech, data, or social media management. It\u2019s usually a paid service, but it\u2019s my way of investing in your efforts. You\u2019ll decide what to focus on during the first week.</p><p><strong>Low-Effort, High-Reward Contribution:</strong> This is a manageable commitment-just under an hour a day for four days a week, contributing thoughtful comments that bring in valuable, consistent, and engaged followers. The commitment lasts only two months. We\u2019ll keep communication open, and if any strategic shifts come up, you\u2019ll be informed directly. Your contribution is valued, and if at any point you need to step back, that\u2019s completely okay.</p><p>There are, however, a few key requirements for participation:</p><p><strong>First Week Commitment:</strong> To ensure a strong start, I\u2019m looking for individuals who can bring in at least seven active followers within the first week, with at least three of them engaging with the content. Don\u2019t worry-I\u2019ll personally guide you through effective strategies to help you do this. If the milestone isn\u2019t met, I\u2019ll need to move on to the next batch of eager participants.</p><p><strong>Consistent Engagement:</strong> For the remaining two months, the expectation is to make 8-10 comments across four days each week. Consistency is key to the success of this initiative-and to your continued participation.</p><p><strong>Essential Tools:</strong> You\u2019ll need a functioning smartphone or laptop with reliable internet access and electricity to participate effectively from day one.</p><p>There\u2019ll be a lot of communication during the first week. By then, everything will be clear. If you\u2019re interested, respond, and I\u2019ll reach out personally, send you a short form-then we can begin our communication from there</p>", "expires": "2025-07-26T00:00:00Z", "org": {"id": "5456e0d7864d49d283b64ec96b7553c6", "name": "Christiana Churchill", "logo": null, "areasOfFocus": ["COMMUNITY_DEVELOPMENT", "EDUCATION", "INTERNATIONAL_RELATIONS", "SCIENCE_TECHNOLOGY"], "orgType": "NONPROFIT", "is501c3": false, "isBCorp": null, "isSocialEnterprise": null, "locale": "en", "governmentId": null, "address": {"full": "Surulere, Lagos, Nigeria, Lagos, NG", "line1": "Surulere, Lagos, Nigeria", "line2": null, "city": "Lagos", "state": null, "stateCode": null, "zipcode": "101271", "country": "NG", "latitude": 6.486653, "longitude": 3.355226, "cityOnly": false}, "url": {"en": "https://www.volunteermatch.org/search/org1258773.jsp", "es": "https://www.volunteermatch.org/search/org1258773.jsp", "pt": "https://www.volunteermatch.org/search/org1258773.jsp"}}, "group": null, "locale": "en", "address": {"full": "Lagos, NG", "line1": null, "line2": null, "city": "Lagos", "state": null, "stateCode": null, "zipcode": null, "country": "NG", "latitude": null, "longitude": null, "cityOnly": true, "description": null}, "applyEmail": null, "applyUrl": null, "applyText": null, "applyOnIdealist": true, "locationType": "REMOTE", "remoteOk": true, "remoteZone": "WORLD", "remoteState": null, "remoteCountry": null, "startDate": "2025-05-26", "endDate": "2025-07-26", "startTime": null, "endTime": null, "timezone": "Africa/Lagos", "starts": "2025-05-25T23:00:00Z", "ends": "2025-07-26T23:00:00Z", "actionType": "VOLOP", "actionTypeText": null, "isCovid": false, "isPostedAnonymously": false, "directions": null, "welcomeGroups": false, "welcomeFamilies": false, "welcomeTeens": false, "welcomeIntl": false, "welcomeAge55Plus": false, "welcomePrivateCorpGroups": false, "detailsStipendProvided": false, "detailsTrainingProvided": false, "detailsHousingAvailable": false, "detailsCulturalSupport": false, "detailsAcademicCreditAvailable": false, "detailsWheelchairAccessible": false, "orientationRequired": true, "backgroundCheckRequired": false, "driversLicenseRequired": false, "feeRequired": false, "feeAmount": null, "isRecurring": true, "timesOfDay": ["WEEKDAYS_DAYTIME", "WEEKENDS_DAYTIME", "WEEKDAYS_EVENINGS", "WEEKENDS_EVENINGS"], "expectedTime": null, "commitmentDetails": "4 - 5hrs a week", "numVolunteersNeeded": 2, "ageRequirement": null, "otherRequirements": "Essential Tools: You\u2019ll need a functioning smartphone or laptop with reliable internet access and electricity to participate effectively from day one.", "functions": ["ADMINISTRATIVE_OFFICE_SUPPORT", "COMMUNICATIONS", "DATA_ANALYSIS", "MENTOR_TUTOR", "TECHNOLOGY_SUPPORT_WEB_DESIGN"], "areasOfFocus": ["COMMUNITY_DEVELOPMENT", "EDUCATION", "SCIENCE_TECHNOLOGY"], "requestedAttachments": [{"label": "Please provide your phone number (optional)", "type": "PHONE", "isRequired": false}, {"label": "How soon are you able to start volunteering?", "type": "TEXT", "isRequired": true}, {"label": "Are you confident working independently, and with minimal support from our staff?", "type": "OPTION_SINGLE", "isRequired": false, "options": [{"value": "Yes"}, {"value": "No"}]}, {"label": "Is there anything you want to ask or tell us?", "type": "TEXT", "isRequired": false}, {"label": "Please provide your zipcode", "type": "TEXT", "isRequired": false}], "requestedAttachmentsHash": "382e1c3d53784556c0cf222efd3851985f6306e81440e19f5649d17737ee506b", "image": null, "url": {"en": "https://www.volunteermatch.org/search/opp3947306.jsp?utm_source=idealist-test&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=listings-api", "es": "https://www.volunteermatch.org/search/opp3947306.jsp?utm_source=idealist-test&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=listings-api", "pt": "https://www.volunteermatch.org/search/opp3947306.jsp?utm_source=idealist-test&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=listings-api"}}, "_version": 2003}
