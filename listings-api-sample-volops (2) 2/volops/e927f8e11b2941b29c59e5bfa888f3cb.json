Every meal saved stays out of the landfill, helping the environment, while also nourishing our community in need. The volunteer role would involve:- Picking up meals from our donor cafeteria, and- Delivering these meals to our non-profit community partner/s in the nearby area. Each volunteer task will take approximately one hour including travel time between donor and recipient. Pick-up and deliveries times will be on a week day (not at weekends) and can be anywhere from early morning to mid afternoon, depending on the donor. We require volunteers to drive their own car. We welcome regular participation but will work with your schedule. Insulated bags will be provided to carry food donations.We are looking for volunteers to rescue and transport food on Wednesdays and Friday afternoons at approximately 2:30 from one location in Morristown to another in Morristown.
